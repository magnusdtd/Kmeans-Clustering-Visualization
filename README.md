# K-Mean-Clustering-Visualization

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data points into a specified number ( k ) of groups. It works by partitioning ( n ) observations into ( k ) clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster1. The algorithm minimizes within-cluster variances, which are squared Euclidean distances1.

Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of how the K-Means Clustering algorithm works:

Initialization: Randomly assign ( k ) cluster centers.
Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest cluster center.
Update: Recalculate the cluster centers as the mean of the assigned data points.
Repeat: Repeat the assignment and update steps until convergence, meaning the assignments no longer change.
This method is widely used in various fields such as market segmentation, pattern recognition, and image compression due to its simplicity and efficiency.
